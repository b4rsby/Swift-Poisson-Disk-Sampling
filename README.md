# Rudimentay Poisson Disk Sampling 

Ruimentary implementation of Poisson Disk Sampling in Swift. I needed to layout nodes in SpriteKit Scene. Using random posistions wasn't cutting it and showed bias to screen width and height. 

Props to samgak on StackOverflow that helped me debug. 

# TODO?

  - Error checking
  - Examples, do some nice layout stuff
  - Examples, will lend it self to generative art
  - add some functions to filter lists

# TODO EXPERIMENT
 - Try combine created seeded lists during generation. 
 - variable / randomised  minimum distance sizes with apprioate stops to avoid infinite loops
